1) loop is initialization is executed:
int i = 0
->declaring and assigning a variable to be used in the loop. This variable that is usually used to keep track of the interations
-> initialization occures once in the begginning of the loop

2) termination condition/boolean value is checked
->if the boolean is true: the code inside the loop is executed
->if the boolean is false: tje loop stops
i<10;
3) code inside the loop are executed top to buttom
System.out.println(i);

4)update
the interation of the variable executes i++;
=>one interation completed
goes back to step two and repeat
